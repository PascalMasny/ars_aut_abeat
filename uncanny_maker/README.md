# uncanny_maker

Offline preprocessing pipeline for *Vallis Simulacri*. Downloads public-domain artworks from the Met Museum Open Access API and generates 10-picture AI-degradation sequences used by the gallery application.

Run this once before the first installation session, or again whenever you want to expand the artwork catalog.

## Prerequisites

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Optional but recommended: [Ollama](https://ollama.com) with the `llava` model for artwork-specific prompt generation.

```bash
ollama pull llava
ollama serve   # keep this running in a separate terminal
```

Without Ollama the pipeline falls back to a generic prompt — results are slightly less tailored but still work fine.

Stable Diffusion v1.5 (~4 GB) is downloaded automatically from Hugging Face on the first run of `iterate_degrade.py`.

## Usage

### Step 1 — Download source artworks

```bash
python download_human_figures.py
```

Queries the Met Museum API for ~200 public-domain works featuring human figures (classical sculpture, Renaissance portraits, figurative paintings) and saves them to `catalog/`. Already-downloaded images are skipped, so the script is safe to re-run.

### Step 2 — Test the curve on one artwork

```bash
python test_single.py catalog/<image>.jpg
```

Generates a single sequence into `catalog_iterations_10_TEST/` with the exact
pipeline settings so the degradation curve can be judged visually before
committing to a full run. Delete the TEST directory afterwards.

### Step 3 — Generate degradation sequences

```bash
python iterate_degrade.py
```

For each image in `catalog/`, generates 10 pictures with Stable Diffusion img2img in two phases: **pictures 1–5 directly from the original** (strength 0.10 → 0.30, fixed per-artwork seed — subtle coherent drift) and **pictures 6–10 chained** output-to-input (strength 0.22 → 0.42, per-step seeds — true model collapse, the paint disintegrates while the composition survives). Output frames are saved to `catalog_iterations_10/<slug>/0000.png` … `0010.png`.

Resumable: frames already on disk are skipped; an artwork is considered done when its `0010.png` exists. Interrupted runs continue from where they left off. Delete an artwork's output directory to force regeneration.

**Options:**

| Flag | Default | Effect |
|------|---------|--------|
| `--workers N` | `8` | Parallel threads for LLaVA prompt fetching |
| `--skip-compile` | off | Skip `torch.compile()` on the UNet (use if it errors) |

**Tunable constants** (top of `iterate_degrade.py`):

| Variable | Default | Effect |
|----------|---------|--------|
| `ITERATIONS` | `10` | Pictures per artwork |
| `DIRECT_COUNT` | `5` | Pictures generated directly from the original |
| `DIRECT_START` / `DIRECT_END` | `0.10` / `0.30` | Strength ramp, direct phase |
| `CHAIN_START` / `CHAIN_END` | `0.22` / `0.42` | Strength ramp, chained phase (>~0.5 re-coheres into a different painting) |
| `GUIDANCE` | `6.0` | Classifier-free guidance scale |
| `STEPS` | `25` | Inference steps (speed vs. quality) |

## Hardware

Device is detected automatically: **MPS** (Apple Silicon) → **CUDA** → **CPU**.

Approximate runtimes per image at default settings (10 iterations):

| Hardware | Time |
|----------|------|
| M4 Max (MPS) | ~1 min |
| NVIDIA GPU (CUDA) | ~30 s |
| CPU only | ~10 min |

## Output

```
catalog_iterations_10/
└── The_Dance_Class_438817/
    ├── 0000.png   ← original (unmodified) — shown during BASELINE
    ├── 0001.png   ← direct, strength 0.10
    │   …
    ├── 0005.png   ← direct, strength 0.30
    │   …
    └── 0010.png   ← chained, disintegrated
```

`catalog_iterations_10/` is excluded from version control. The app reads it via `UNCANNY_ITER_DIR` in `ars_aut_abeat/config.py`. The older 50/100-frame sets in `catalog_iterations/` are an archive of the previous concept and are no longer read.

## Configuration

All model/server settings are in `config.py`:

```python
OLLAMA_URL     = "http://localhost:11434"
OLLAMA_MODEL   = "llava"
SD_MODEL_ID    = "runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5"
DEFAULT_STRENGTH = 0.55
DEFAULT_GUIDANCE = 7.5
NEGATIVE_PROMPT  = "cartoon, anime, painting, sketch, blurry, ..."
```

See [`docs/PIPELINE.md`](../docs/PIPELINE.md) for a detailed explanation of the degradation algorithm and why it produces uncanny-valley-specific distortion.
